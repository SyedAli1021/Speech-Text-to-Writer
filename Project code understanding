1)first of all we will import speech_recognition as sr.
2)Notice that we have speech_recognition in such  format  whereas earlier we have installed it in this way SpeechRecognition , so you need to have a look around the cases because this is case sensitive.
3)Now we have used as notation  because writing speech_recognition whole every time is not a good way.
4)Now we have to initialize r = sr.Recognizer() ,this will work as a recognizer to recognize our voice.
5)So, with sr.Microphone() as source: which means that we are initialising our source to sr.Microphone ,we can also use some audio files to convert into text but in this tutorial i am using Microphone voice.
6)Next we will print a simple statement that recommend the user to speak anything.
7)Now we have to use r.listen(source) command and we have to listen the source.So, it will listen to the source and store it in the audio.
8)It may happen some time the audio is not clear and you might not get it correctly ,so we can put it inside the try and except block .
9)So inside the try block, our text will be text = r.recognize_google(audio) ,now we have various options like recognize_bing(),recognize_google_cloud(),recognize_ibm(), etc.But for this one i am using recognize_google().And lastly we have to pass our audio.
10)And this will convert our audio into text.
11)Now we just have to print print(“You said : {}”.format(text)) ,this will print whatever you have said.
12)In the except block we can just write  print(“Sorry could not recognize your voice”) ,this will message you if your voice is not recorded clearly.
